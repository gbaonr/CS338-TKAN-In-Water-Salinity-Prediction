# Salinity Forecasting in the Saigon River using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TKAN)

## 📌 Introduction  
Accurate prediction of raw water salinity is crucial for effective water supply management and environmental protection. In southern Vietnam, the **Saigon River** plays a vital role as a primary water source for domestic and agricultural use. However, salinity levels fluctuate significantly due to **tidal forces, rainfall patterns, and upstream dam operations**, posing challenges for freshwater availability, irrigation, and treatment plant operations.  

Traditional statistical methods often fail to capture the **nonlinear and dynamic** characteristics of salinity patterns under hydrological variability. To address this limitation, our study explores the **Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TKAN)**, a recent deep learning architecture designed for time-series forecasting.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a **reliable salinity forecasting model** for the Saigon River.  
- Compare the performance of **TKAN** with well-established baselines: **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks  
- Provide a foundation for **water resource management** and **salinity intrusion prevention** in urban river systems.  

---

## 🧠 Methodology  
- **Dataset**: Real-world salinity measurements collected from the Saigon River.  
- **Models**:  
  - TKAN (proposed)  
  - LSTM (baseline)  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  

---

## 📊 Results  
- TKAN consistently outperformed LSTM and TCN baselines.  
- Achieved **lower MAE and MAPE**, demonstrating superior ability to capture complex temporal dependencies.  
- Showed **better generalization** across varying hydrological conditions.

## 🌍 Impact  
This work highlights the potential of modern deep learning methods for **environmental monitoring and decision-making support**. By improving salinity forecasting in the Saigon River, the project contributes to:  
- **Sustainable water supply management**  
- **Irrigation planning**  
- **Mitigation of saline intrusion risks**
